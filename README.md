I'm a passionate tech enthusiast with a bachelor's degree in Web Technologies and Digital Images from the African Higher School of ICT (ESATIC). Currently, I'm pursuing a Master‚Äôs degree (Msc BIHAR) at ESATIC, where I'm focused on enhancing my skills in information technology, particularly in artificial intelligence.

- üåê **ES-blog**: I run and developed a blog where I share insights on ICT news, student projects, and other tech-related topics. One of its standout features is DORA, a fact-checker designed to effectively combat misinformation.[Check it out for the latest updates and articles!](https://esblog.info)

- üì∑ **MyPhotoCard**:  I‚Äôm also the developer and co-founder of MyPhotoCard, an online platform for printing photos in Polaroid and sticker formats. We also offer on-site photo shoots during events to capture and preserve memorable moments. [Snap it. Print it. Keep the magic!](https://cypher1305.github.io)
  
- üïäÔ∏è **JIREH.**: I built a solidarity-based donation platform to streamline awareness campaigns, donation drives, and the fair redistribution of goods to those in need, as well as support for formation and professional insertion.
